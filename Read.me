1- Add at least 3 new <div> containers (or other HTML elements) to your index.html (or create a new page).

Give each a different class or id

Put some content inside (text, image, etc.)






2- Style those new containers in style.css with at least the following:

-A background color

-Padding

-Margin

-A border (with thickness, style, color)

-A different font (via font-family)

=A change in text color





3- Make one part of the page look visibly inconsistent — e.g.

-One container with a wildly contrasting text/background

-A heading that’s huge and off-center

-A floated image that overlaps text





4-Use class vs id appropriately
-At least one style must target by .className { … }

-At least one style must target by #idName { … }







5-Image centering / sizing
-Add at least one <img>

-Give it a class (e.g. class="center" or something silly)

-In CSS, center it (e.g. display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;)

-Optionally change its width/height





6-Add two headings (e.g. <h2>) and override their style
-For example, make them white text on white background (so they disappear) or give them weird alignment
-Use !important in one rule to override inherited styles






7-Bonus / stretch goals (pick at least one):
-Use :hover pseudoclass to change something when hovering

-Use border-radius or box-shadow to make something look “glow-y” or distorted

-Use Google Fonts (add <link> in your <head> and font-family)

-Make one container rotate slightly using transform: rotate(...)

-Use CSS grid or flexbox to place at least one container off-norm (e.g. intentionally break alignment)
