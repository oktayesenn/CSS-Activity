		<p>There are a lot of websites in this world: some look good, and some... don't. This is probably going to be one of the ones that doesn't. We want to have space to make things weird and wacky and to experiment with all the CSS we are learning without focusing on good design, and that's okay! Let loose! Make things get crazy!</p>

			<h2>Let's talk about good design on our ugly site:</h2>
		</div>
		
		<p>Even if you're looking at something ugly, you can always spend time learning about good design. There are a lot of fundamentals of good design to pay attention to when you start making your own websites.</p>

			<h3>Principles of Good Web Design:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Have a clear purpose for each page</li>
				<li>Simplicity: don't have too much going on!</li>
				<li>Give users an easy navigation method</li>
				<li>"F-Shaped" reading (most people will see top and left first)</li>
				<li>Have a visual hierarchy - most important things are the biggest</li>
				<li>Include compelling and useful content</li>
				<li>Arrange things as a grid</li>
				<li>Make sure it loads quickly!</li>
				<li>Websites should be viewable on a phone</li>
			</ol>

			<p><a href="https://youtu.be/pnv5iKB2hl4">This video </a>isn't really about web design (it's about flags), but it can still be really useful in helping us think about what makes good and bad design.</p>

			<h2>Let's talk more about bad design:</h2>
		</div>
		
		<div>
			<p>
				It might seem obvious to us now that the traits of bad design are just the opposites of the traits of good design, and while that is true, we are going to go ahead and list some other contributors that can make our designs be considered BAD.
			</p>
		</div>

		<div>
			<ul>
				<li>The design does not make sense in the context of the page. (Think: a funeral parlor website styled in neons.)</li>
				<li>The design is distracting, by having too much happening or similar.</li>
				<li>Things are hard to use, because of placement or because it's hard to see or otherwise navigate</li>
				<li>Likewise, if the design is forgettable, it's also considered bad. We want to be remembered, but for the right reasons.</li>
				<li>The design is super topical/short-lived, ex: it won't be trendy in a week.</li>
			</ul>
		</div>
	</div>

		<div>
			<h2>And now, just to be certain, some filler.</h2>
		</div>

		<div>
			<p>
				Just to make sure you have enough page to play with, let's also introduce a component of designs both good and bad: the filler text.
			</p>

			<p>Filler text is just that - text that fills a space until the real words get put in. If you worked for a company, it is likely that one person is designing the site while another is writing the 'copy' (words to go on the page) that will be added later. Hence, temporary filler text!</p>
